# EmoBot-Mental-Wellbeing-Chatbot-using-Machine-Learning

Problem Statement:
Despite the growing awareness of mental health issues, access to timely and effective support remains a challenge for many individuals. Traditional mental health services are often inaccessible due to barriers such as cost, stigma, and shortage of trained professionals. Additionally, there is a lack of scalable solutions that can provide immediate support and guidance to individuals in need. Existing chatbot applications in the mental health domain often lack the sophistication and empathy required to engage with users and address their concerns effectively. Furthermore, these chatbots may not be adequately trained on diverse datasets containing real-world conversations related to mental health.

Proposed work:

-Develop an advanced mental health chatbot leveraging NLP and ML.

-Integrate principles of Behavioral Activation (BA) therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

-Collect and preprocess data from various sources.

-Build and train a machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.

-Develop a web-based interface using Flask and JavaScript.

-Test and evaluate the chatbot's performance.
